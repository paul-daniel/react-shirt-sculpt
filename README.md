## Live Application

Experience the application yourself: [3D T-Shirt Customizer Live](http://react-three-openai.s3-website.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/)


## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

# install the server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# start the server
npm run backend:development

# install the client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# start the client (do this in two separate terminals)
npm run dev-css
npm run dev
```

Note that the application is by default in production mode. To change that,
go to client/src/store/index.ts and replace the content with the code bellow

```typescript
import {proxy} from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({
    intro : true,
    color : '#EFBD4E',
    isLogoTexture : true,
    isFullTexture : false,
    logoDecal : './threejs.png',
    fullDecal : './threejs.png',
    mode : "dev"
})

export default state
```

Now you have it working ! Feel free to add more features and share them with me and others if you want.
